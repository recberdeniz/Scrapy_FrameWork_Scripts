# Spotify Top 200 Music List on Global Project
<br>
This code script is written by @recberdeniz to exercise about python scrapy framework application for Python Programming
This script is basically finding a top 200 song on global from Spotify and scraping with Scrapy Framework 
For this script can describe that order, status, artist, song name, week info, streams, streams+
and total of the first 200 songs on Spotify global list. For this scraping process, unfortunately, I did not use spotify.com
Thus, data was scrapped from https://kworb.net, robots.txt file checked and data just used for exercise.
<br>
Postscript: Before using scrapy framework, please check the robots.txt for that website. Such as; https://kworbs.net/robots.txt
